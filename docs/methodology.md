# Reflection Agent Methodology

## 1. Theoretical Foundation

### 1.1 Reflective Learning
Reflective learning is a meta-learning method where the agent not only learns how to perform tasks but also learns how to learn. Through regular self-evaluation, the agent can:
- Identify the effectiveness of current strategies
- Adjust learning parameters
- Optimize decision-making processes

### 1.2 Multi-Memory Systems
The human brain has short-term and long-term memory systems, which this project simulates:
- **Short-term Memory**: Quickly adapt to environment changes
- **Long-term Memory**: Preserve stable general strategies
- **Memory Balance**: Dynamically adjust weights of both memories

## 2. Core Algorithms

### 2.1 Reflection Mechanism
```python
def reflect(self, state, action, reward, next_state, done, steps):
    # Reflect every 5 steps
    if len(self.reflection_memory) >= self.reflection_frequency:
        # Calculate performance metrics
        performance_score = self.calculate_performance()
        
        # Adjust strategy based on performance
        if performance_score < self.adaptation_threshold:
            self.adapt_strategy()
```

### 2.2 Environment Change Detection
```python
def _detect_environment_change(self, state, action, next_state, reward):
    # Compare current results with historical results
    if state_action_key in self.state_action_results:
        previous_results = self.state_action_results[state_action_key]
        
        # Check result consistency
        if not self._is_consistent(previous_results, (next_state, reward)):
            self.environment_stability *= 0.8
            self._adapt_to_environment_change()
```

### 2.3 Dual Memory Q-Learning
```python
def _update_q_values(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
    # Short-term memory update (high learning rate)
    short_term_alpha = min(0.8, self.alpha * 1.5)
    self.q_table_short_term[state][action] = self._q_learning_update(
        self.q_table_short_term[state][action], 
        reward, 
        next_state, 
        short_term_alpha
    )
    
    # Long-term memory update (low learning rate)
    long_term_alpha = max(0.1, self.alpha * 0.7)
    self.q_table_long_term[state][action] = self._q_learning_update(
        self.q_table_long_term[state][action], 
        reward, 
        next_state, 
        long_term_alpha
    )
```
