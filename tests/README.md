# Reflection Agent Test Suite

This directory contains unit tests for the Reflection Agent project that I created to ensure code quality and reliability.

## 🧪 Test Coverage

The test suite covers the following areas:

### Core Functionality
- ✅ Agent initialization and configuration
- ✅ Action selection mechanisms (exploration vs exploitation)
- ✅ Q-learning updates (short-term and long-term memory)
- ✅ Reflection mechanism (every 5 steps)
- ✅ Environment change detection
- ✅ Strategy adaptation based on performance

### Memory Systems
- ✅ Dual memory system (short-term vs long-term)
- ✅ Memory balance adjustment based on environment stability
- ✅ Wall memory functionality
- ✅ Experience replay with priority sampling
- ✅ Knowledge transfer between memory systems

### Edge Cases
- ✅ Error handling for invalid inputs
- ✅ Empty buffer handling
- ✅ None goal position handling
- ✅ Boundary conditions

## 📊 Current Coverage

- **Overall Coverage**: 69%
- **Test Count**: 19 tests
- **All Tests Passing**: ✅

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Basic Test Run
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest test_reflection_agent.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest test_reflection_agent.py --cov=reflection_agent --cov-report=term-missing
```

### Specific Test Categories
```bash
# Run only unit tests
python -m pytest test_reflection_agent.py -m unit

# Run only integration tests
python -m pytest test_reflection_agent.py -m integration

# Skip slow tests
python -m pytest test_reflection_agent.py -m "not slow"
```

## 📝 Test Structure

### Test Classes
- `TestReflectionAgent`: Main test suite for the ReflectionAgent class

### Test Categories
1. **Initialization Tests**: Verify proper agent setup
2. **Action Selection Tests**: Test exploration and exploitation
3. **Learning Tests**: Verify Q-learning updates
4. **Reflection Tests**: Test the core reflection mechanism
5. **Memory Tests**: Test dual memory system
6. **Environment Tests**: Test change detection and adaptation
7. **Edge Case Tests**: Test error handling and boundary conditions

## 🎯 Test Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Test methods start with `test_`
- Descriptive names that explain what is being tested
- Use underscores to separate words

### Test Organization
- Use fixtures for common setup
- Group related tests together
- Use clear assertions with descriptive messages

### Coverage Goals
- Aim for >80% coverage
- Focus on critical paths
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## 🔧 Adding New Tests

When adding new tests:

1. **Follow the existing pattern** in `test_reflection_agent.py`
2. **Use descriptive names** that explain the test purpose
3. **Add appropriate markers** (`@pytest.mark.unit`, `@pytest.mark.integration`)
4. **Update this README** with new test categories
5. **Run the full test suite** to ensure no regressions

## 📈 Continuous Integration

The test suite is designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

- Fast execution (< 1 second)
- No external dependencies
- Clear pass/fail results
- Coverage reporting

## 🤝 Contributing

When contributing tests:

1. **Write tests first** (TDD approach)
2. **Test both success and failure cases**
3. **Use mocking** for external dependencies
4. **Keep tests independent** and isolated
5. **Document complex test scenarios**
